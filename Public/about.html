                <p>
                    There was a time when people thought of psychological therapy as a taboo. Fortunatley things
                    changed, and help was offered to everyone that needed it and everyone that asked for it.
                    <br /> But now times has changed... life got a little fast, we grew a little distant, we forgot to
                    stop for a minute a look inside of us...we forgot about ourselves while trying to catch up on life,
                    be there for our famliy, our friends...
                    We got stressed chasing our dreams, achieve our goals, fighting for what we believe is destined for
                    us...
                    <br /> Somewhere along the way we all felt down, we all felt caged, we forsed ourselves to see
                    though the jungle but we just couldnt, we were stressed, we were somewhat depressed... we were just
                    lost... And the thing is we didn't want
                    to slow down because the one second you put your guard down we felt like things slipped from our
                    fingers...
                    <br /> This is where we come in play!!!
                    <br /> We are here to help you along the way in the easiest possible way, we are here for you day
                    and night, to listen to you, to support you, to guide you, to help you get pass your stress, your
                    inner struggles, your depression, your
                    obsession, hell even if you need someone just to talk to... We are HERE!
                    <br /> We are here at the tip of your fingers, you just need to reach for us, online chat, online
